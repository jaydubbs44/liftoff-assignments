## Submission Instructions

### Overview
How many women are struggling to join/rejoin the workforce after becoming mothers? It is not uncommon for a woman to leave the workforce to become a full time caregiver, sometimes with the hope of returning a few months or even years later. Unfortunately, hoping is not the same as succeeding in doing so. Many women attempting to rejoin the workforce after some time encounter many obstacles: They no longer have the experience necessary, their previous job is family-inhospitable, etc.

What our team is trying to achieve with our website is to offer these women a second chance in their professional life by connecting them with educational resources and entry-level positions in the technology sector. We want to be able to list free resources so they can prepare and learn a new coding skill at their own pace, or just stay updated on their field of experience. We want them to be able to find job opportunities in the technology sector that fit their requirements and their new life.


### Features
-Informational Landing/Home Page:
Home page should introduce the job matching and resource matching concept to new and prospective users.
-Authentication (Account Log-in/Log-out) and Authorization requirement to access features that need users to possess an account
In order to prevent spam account creation, users will need to validate their identity before credentials are entered into the accounts database and use the matching features.
-Profile Creation:
Users should be able to login to the site and save their job preferences.
-Job Matching Page:
Users can be matched with jobs for which their profiles fit. Users can also see jobs that their profile may not be a good fit for and link to appropriate job resources.
-Resources page with links to free courses/video tutorials etc.
Users can see resources for which job descriptions may not already be the best fit.


-Users can add their own resources:
Users can add resources if they know of something that is not already included in the resources database/page.
